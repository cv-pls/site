Tags can be put anywhere in a chat message except in formatted code to create a tag like ![cv-pls](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zhlks.png) by entering its corresponding markdown code. Multiple tag types may be used for a single post if  necessary.

| Common Usage(s) |  Markdown  | Meaning |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| cv-pls | `[tag:cv-pls]` | post may need to be *closed* |
| delv-pls | `[tag:delv-pls]` | post may need to be *deleted* |
| undelv-pls | `[tag:undelv-pls]` | post may need to be *un-deleted* |
| ro-pls<br>rov-pls<br>reopen-pls | `[tag:ro-pls]`<br>`[tag:rov-pls]`<br>`[tag:reopen-pls]` | post may need to be *re-opened* |
| rv-pls<br>review-pls | `[tag:rv-pls]`<br>`[tag:review-pls]` | post may need to be *reviewed* |
| flag-pls | `[tag:flag-pls]` | post may need to be *flagged* |

> **Links marked with  `[tag:cv-pls]` or  `[tag:delv-pls]` tags will be indexed in the cv-pls [backlog](http://cvbacklog.gordon-oheim.biz/ )**.

<br>Close-Vote Acronyms <sup><a title='Close-Vote Acronyms' href='#close-vote-acronyms' name='close-vote-acronyms'><img src='http://i.stack.imgur.com/ezLZa.png'></a></sup>
---

Acronyms are case insensitive. They may be be used in chat tags in the markdown format as `[tag:acronym]` to create a tag like ![cv-pls](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5UZkA.png) for example, or just by themselves as `acronym` . They are used to specify what close type applies to the  linked post.

| Acronym | Close Type Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| **DUPE**<br>*(duplicate)* | This question has been asked before and already has an answer. |
| **OT**<br>*(off topic)* | This question does not appear to be about programming, within the scope defined in the help center for the linked StackExchange site. |
| **UWYA**<br>*(unclear&nbsp;what&nbsp;you're&nbsp;asking)* | Please clarify your specific problem or add additional details to highlight exactly what you need. As it's currently written, it’s hard to tell exactly what you're asking. |
| **TB**<br>*(too&nbsp;broad)* |There are either too many possible answers, or good answers would be too long for this format. Please add details to narrow the answer set or to isolate an issue that can be answered in a few paragraphs. |
| **POB**<br>*(primarily&nbsp;opinion-based)* | Many good questions generate some degree of opinion based on expert experience, but answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions, rather than facts, references, or specific expertise. |

> **These chat tags DO NOT get indexed in the cv-pls [backlog](http://cvbacklog.gordon-oheim.biz/ ). If using these tags be sure to use the tag `[tag:cv-pls]` in conjunction. For example : `[tag:cv-pls][tag:pob]` to create a tag like ![cv-pls](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FDgWC.png)**

*Unofficially* cv-ring members are modifying their avatars to include a broomstick icon ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/b7V9o.png) in the lower-right corner. This is to symbolize helping cleanup StackOverflow of low quality content. The trend was started by [@PeeHaa 埽](http://stackoverflow.com/users/508666/peehaa) and is slowly becoming popular. To show your continued support of being part of the cv-ring you can bling up your avatar by  [downloading](http://cv-pls.com/broom.xcf) the`.xcf` file. You will need  [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) to edit it.

1. Place your avatar on the blank *avatar* layer keeping the *broom* layer on top 
 - *optionally you can make the broom smaller, but keep it in lower-right corner*
2. Then *export* the file as a PNG (.png)
3. Upload the avatar in your SE profile page
