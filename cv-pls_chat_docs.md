<br>Meaning <sup><a title='What Does It Mean?' href='#cv-pls-meaning' name='cv-pls-meaning'><img src='http://i.stack.imgur.com/ezLZa.png'></a></sup>
---

In the [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/) [PHP chat](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/11/php) you may notice the regulars using tags like `cv-pls`, `cv-ring` and others. These tags are used only in the chat room to communicate with other users that a post may need some sort of moderation. The documentation below outlines all the possible actions and meanings of each acronym and its usage.

`cv-ring` is just a 'funny name' we give to the group of regulars who use the tags, It is not a cult, there is no membership fee, secret hand-shake or conspiracy afoot. To join the `cv-ring` just actively participate in helping maintain the quality of the site's posts by following the proper usage of the close-vote chat tags.

The Stack Exchange sites can accumulate a lot of inferior quality and duplicative information. We feel that inferior quality questions bring down the sites and make it harder to find good information. By closing and merging these posts as appropriate you'll find the information you need quicker. This is a community based approach in quality assurance to help ensure that these sites can provide the best information to those that seek it.

There's been a question on [meta.stackoverflow.com](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/) that [asks whether the community should vote-to-close in this way](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/120275/is-asking-others-for-a-close-vote-appropriate) if you feel the need to provide feedback. If you have a problem with the process or notice abuse please post something on meta or talk to us in [PHP chat](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/11/php). This process is meant to help the community, but can easily start hurting the community and that is not our intent.

<br>Chat Tags <sup><a title='Chat Tags' href='#chat-tags' name='chat-tags'><img src='http://i.stack.imgur.com/ezLZa.png'></a></sup>
---

Tags can be put anywhere in a chat message except in formatted code to create a tag like ![cv-pls](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7NIIN.png) by entering its corresponding markdown code. Multiple tag types may be used for a single post if  necessary.

> **Important: there MUST be a space between the chat tag and the question URL. Omitting it will prevent the URL from being converted into a link.**

| Common Usage(s) |  Markdown  | Meaning |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| cv-pls | `[tag:cv-pls]` | post may need to be *closed* |
| delv-pls | `[tag:delv-pls]` | post may need to be *deleted* |
| undelv-pls | `[tag:undelv-pls]` | post may need to be *un-deleted* |
| ro-pls<br>rov-pls<br>reopen-pls | `[tag:ro-pls]`<br>`[tag:rov-pls]`<br>`[tag:reopen-pls]` | post may need to be *re-opened* |
| rv-pls<br>review-pls | `[tag:rv-pls]`<br>`[tag:review-pls]` | post may need to be *reviewed* |
| flag-pls | `[tag:flag-pls]` | post may need to be *flagged* |

> **Links marked with  `[tag:cv-pls]` tags will be indexed in the cv-pls chat  [backlog](http://cv-pls.com/backlog?chatroom).**

<br>Close-Vote Acronyms <sup><a title='Close-Vote Acronyms' href='#close-vote-acronyms' name='close-vote-acronyms'><img src='http://i.stack.imgur.com/ezLZa.png'></a></sup>
---

Acronyms are case insensitive. They may be be used in chat tags in the markdown format as `[tag:acronym]` to create a tag like ![cv-pls](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5UZkA.png) for example, or just by themselves as `acronym` . They are used to specify what close type applies to the  linked post.

| Acronym | Close Type Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| **DUPE**<br>*(duplicate)* | This question has been asked before and already has an answer. |
| **OT**<br>*(off topic)* | This question does not appear to be about programming, within the scope defined in the help center for the linked Stack Exchange site. |
| **UWYA**<br>*(unclear&nbsp;what&nbsp;you're&nbsp;asking)* | Please clarify your specific problem or add additional details to highlight exactly what you need. As it's currently written, it’s hard to tell exactly what you're asking. |
| **TB**<br>*(too&nbsp;broad)* |There are either too many possible answers, or good answers would be too long for this format. Please add details to narrow the answer set or to isolate an issue that can be answered in a few paragraphs. |
| **POB**<br>*(primarily&nbsp;opinion-based)* | Many good questions generate some degree of opinion based on expert experience, but answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions, rather than facts, references, or specific expertise. |

> **These chat tags DO NOT get indexed in the cv-pls chat [backlog](http://cv-pls.com/backlog?chatroom). If using these tags be sure to use the tag `[tag:cv-pls]` in conjunction. For example : `[tag:cv-pls][tag:pob]` to create a tag like ![cv-pls](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FDgWC.png)**

<br>Avatar Bling <sup><a title='Avatar Bling' href='#avatar-bling' name='avatar-bling'><img src='http://i.stack.imgur.com/ezLZa.png'></a></sup>

*Unofficially* cv-ring members are modifying their avatars to include a broomstick icon ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/b7V9o.png) in the lower-right corner. This is to symbolize helping cleanup StackOverflow of low quality content. The trend was started by [@PeeHaa](http://stackoverflow.com/users/508666/peehaa) and is slowly becoming popular. To show your continued support of being part of the cv-ring you can bling up your avatar by:

- Appending your avatar URL to `http://broom.stackoverflow.so/?` (e.g. `http://broom.stackoverflow.so/?http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4f3af728d5ff76fc417f47279b3bc3b?s=256`), new avatar with broom will be generated. Save it locally and upload the avatar in your SE profile page.

- [Downloading](http://cv-pls.com/assets/download/broom.xcf) the`.xcf` file. You will need  [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) to edit it.

1. Place your avatar on the blank *avatar* layer keeping the *broom* layer on top 
 - *optionally you can make the broom smaller, but keep it in lower-right corner*
2. Then *export* the file as a PNG (.png)
3. Upload the avatar in your SE profile page
