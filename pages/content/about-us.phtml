<h1>About us</h1>
<p>cv-pls Helper makes the process of closing questions easier on Stack Overflow. There are a lot of 'bad' questions being asked and to <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/120275/is-asking-others-for-a-close-vote-appropriate" target="_blank">help reduce the noise</a> these questions should be closed as fast as possible.</p>
<p>This extension in no way automagically closes questions on a close vote request, but rather makes the review process better.</p>
<p>The extension parses [cv-pls] and [delv] requests in the chat of Stack Overflow. An example of a request is: <code>[tag:cv-pls] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9991825/arabic-in-extjs-grid</code>. When the extension sees a request it will parse it into a nice onebox. Optionally it will also notify the user by sound (Stack Overflow chat @mention beep) or by avatar notification (like mention / flag popup).</p>
